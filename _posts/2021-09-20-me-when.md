   Yes, the most important thing that differentiates manga series and helps them stand out is the logos used for the titles. Whether it's the same as the anime or original to the printed manga, it sure helps to see the title on the cover or spine in all its glory. 

   That being said, where is this incorporating a logo done well on printed manga, and where is it done quite badly? I will be showing 5 examples of each (good vs. bad) that I have seen through my adventures of both buying physical copies of manga and watching their anime counterparts. 



## The Good:

The logo of this series is very unique, and what I can imagine, may be hard to convert into a printed format. It was taken directly from the anime, as well, and I think the English physicals did a very good job converting the logo to the spine and cover so it was clear and easy to read. It definitely stands out amongst the rest of the books on a shelf, which it was, of course, I really like considering it is one of my favourite series. The numbers of the volumes also have the same kind of font which I think brings a lot more the overall cohesiveness of the series on a shelf.
