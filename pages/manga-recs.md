###### Instead of just the typographic design on the outside, it's the inside that really matters! Here are some manga I strongly recommend (if you are interested in reading) that aren't as popular as series like *My Hero Academia* or *Naruto*, with a really professional and good description of the story. <3

* ***Life Lessons with Uramichi-Oniisan* by Gaku Kuze**

  * 30 year old man is the host of a kids TV show an hates his life. Geniunely one of the funniest things I have ever read. Pros: has bird demon that carries a baguette and haunts Uramichi's nightmares. 
* ***Toilet-Bound Hanako-Kun* by Aidalro**

  * Weird title, good story. Hanako-kun is a ghost that haunts Nene Yashiro's school as one of the '*Seven Mysteries of Kamome Academy'.* Yashiro summons Hanako to help with her love life thinking Hanako's a girl, but he's actually a boy! Just a lot of beautiful art mixed with a supernatural but light-hearted story. 
* ***Chainsaw Man* by Tatsuki Fujimoto**

  * This one is pretty popular, but I had to put it on here because it's just so good. Denji is homeless and nearly dies, but the chainsaw demon Pochita saves him by posessing him. A LOT happens in this series. Don't get attatched to any characters. However, it's one of the best pieces of fiction I've ever read. 
* ***Blue Period* by Tsubasa Yamaguchi**

  * Yatora Yaguchi is (kinda) your average Japanese high schooler but not at all. He's a delienquent, but also a genius who studies hard but has no idea what he wants to do with his life until he accidentally walks into the art club and becomes captivated by one of his seniors paintings. He then throws himself into art and we see Yatora grow into a very talented young man. I love this series so much AHHHH!
* ***ZOM 100: Bucket List of the Dead* by Haro Aso**

  * Thought I would hate this, actually love it. Akira is a 'slave' to his company and is completely sick of his life. But then a zombie apocolypse happens, and he feels free for the first time in 3 years! He makes a bucket list to complete before the zombies completely take over. It's very fun even though his surroundings are kinda gross. 
* ***Love Me Love Me Not* by Io Sakisaka**

  * Love square?? Yuna Ichihara likes Rio Yamamoto but he likes his stepsister (YES ITS WEIRD BUT SHE HATES IT I PROMISE THIS SERIES IS GOOD) Akari Yamamoto but she likes a guy named Kazuomi Inui. Lots of drama but has happy ending. 
* ***Sasaki and Miyano* by Shou Harusono**

  * Miyano is a 'Boy's Love' enthusiast who hasn't realized he's probably in the most cliche BL plotline ever where his senior Sasaki is crushing on him. Sasaki keeps trying to give hints to Miyano that he likes him but Miyano is probably the most naive person ever when it comes to his own relationships. Just a cute romance idk
* ***Eniale & Dewiela* by Kamome Shirahama**

  * Angel Enaile and demon Dewiela are friends most of the time but they also hate each other. They both love fashion though and bond over it. This manga is only three volumes and just explores the chaos they get into together! Absolutely gorgeous art as well :)
