**Emma Pollard** decided to make a blog on typography in manga simply because she loves reading it. She is an avid collector of physical manga as well, so the way they look on her Ikea Billie shelves with Oxford doors is very important to her. If their typography on the spines is ugly, she'll hide them behind series or on a bottom shelf. Generally, she thinks manga designs are pretty and need to be looked at more by the general public. 

The featured image is Emma's beautiful and prized collection of romance manga, even though she claims to hate the *shoujo* genre of anime/manga - she actually is just lying to herself.
